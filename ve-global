They   recruit incredible people from all over the globe to go and volunteer in children's orphanages throughout the Santiago area.  Most of these children have been removed from their family homes due to abuse and neglect.  They've had a very rough start to life and it is VE Global's mission to bring happiness and security to their lives.<br>		A good friend of mine went to volunteer there for a year and I was lucky enough to pay him a visit for a few weeks and saw first hand how hard they work.<br>		When a new class of volunteers arrive they are given a t-shirt that has been designed by the other volunteers and I was happy to help bring their designs to life by creating them in Illustrator and sending the finished file back to them to take to the print shop.  The work wasn't about groundbreaking design, it was about doing something to help a good cause and I was more than happy to help.</p>		<p class="web-address">Visit VE Global's website <a href="http://www.ve-global.org">here</a> to learn more and to see the great work they do in Santiago.</p>				<p>Click <a href="/work">here</a> to return to my work page.</p>				</div><!---close content-wrapper"-->				</div><!---close page wrapper---->		</body></html>
