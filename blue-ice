Matt hired me to  create a new look for 		his company that would include a new website and a logo as well as a blogging platform that he could email daily posts to.  		The main purpose for the work was to market his business name, photos, and life style to try and generate revenue away from 		the flying and as a natural side effect, his flying would benefit too.</p>		The result:		<ul>		<li>400% increase in web traffic</li>		<li>A blog that receiver over 4,000 visitors a month</li>		<li>Over 300 contacts from the web compared to 0 from the previous site</li>		<li>8% increase in revenue from online sources</li>		</ul>				 <p>I've yet to meet Matt face-to-face but with the modern wonders of internet communication I was able to deliver him a project that he is very happy with.  I look forward to a trip to Alaska to meet Matt and experience his lifestyle someday. </p>		</div> <!-- close client info --> <div id="wrapper">        <div id="slider-wrapper">                    <div id="slider" class="nivoSlider">                <img src="images/blueice/home-screenshot.png" title="#home-title" />                <img src="images/blueice/blog-screenshot.png" title="#blog-title" />                <img src="images/blueice/flightseeing-screenshot.png" alt="" title="#flight-title" />                <img src="images/blueice/shop-screenshot.png" alt="" title="#shop-title"/>                <img src="images/blueice/pricepage-screenshot.png" alt="" title="#htmlcaption" />                <img src="images/blueice/analytics-screenshot.png" alt="" title="#analytics-title" />            </div>            <div id="htmlcaption" class="nivo-html-caption">                <strong>Pricing Page</strong><br/> Pricing page with links to the contact page.            </div>            <div id="home-title" class="nivo-html-caption">            	<strong>Homepage</strong><br/> I created large buttons to give the site a clean, simple look.

I have used photoshop for years and I'm familiar with the interface so I figured it would just be a case of learning the tools.

Armed with a text book, Google, and a lot of spare time, I set about playing with ideas and eventually carved out a winner.  </p>  	<ul>  	<li>Simple, clean look</li>  	<li>Transfers well to clothing</li>  	<li>Signature landing light and bush wheels</li>  	<li>Based on clients favorite picture of him in his plane</li>  	</ul>         <div class="vimeo-wrapper">    <h2 class="blueice">Going the extra mile</h2>    	<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/9366117" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0"></iframe>    	    	<p class="vimeo-text">Matt wanted to show he was an experienced bush pilot who has been in the business for a long time and not some rookie.  He sent me a bunch of pics of clients in his cub and asked me to come up with a way of displaying them on a testimonials page.  I decided to create a video of Polaroid pictures building up in to a pile. It's a refreshing alternative to a slideshow and gets the point across all the same.</p>    	</div>    	<div id="blog">    	<h2 class="blueice">The Blog</h2>    	<p>The blog has been an incredible success and that all comes down to the content.  Matt is very diligent in making sure he posts as picture of the day and has been rewarded with a healthy number of readers.<br/>    		We chose to use Posterous for his blog as it's a very easy to use platform that is totally customizable.  I enjoyed the challenge of getting the blog to look and feel like the main website.  The blog is a book in the making and that is a project already in the pipeline.    	</p>    	</div>    	<!--	<div id="skills-learned">	<h2 class="blue">Skills Learned</h2>	<p>This whole project was </p>	</div> -->    	<div id="bottomnav">    	<div id="bottomleft"><a href="work"><< Return to the Work page</a></div>    	<div id="bottomright"><a href="http://www.blueiceaviation.com">Visit the Blue Ice Aviation site >></a></div>         </div>			</div><!-- close content-wrapper"-->				</div><!-- close page wrapper -->		</body></html>
